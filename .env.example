# Brevo (formerly SendinBlue) API Configuration
VITE_BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Sign up for a free Brevo account at https://www.brevo.com/
# 2. Go to SMTP & API section in your Brevo dashboard
# 3. Generate a new API key with "Send emails" permission
# 4. Copy this file to .env and replace 'your_brevo_api_key_here' with your actual API key
# 5. Make sure to verify your sender email domain in Brevo dashboard
# 6. Restart your development server after adding the API key

# The API key will be visible in the browser, so only use this for development/demo purposes
# For production, consider using a backend service to handle email sending securely
